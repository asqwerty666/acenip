<h1 id="SLURM">SLURM</h1>

<p>Just a function to send the jobs to SLURM from the Perl scripts</p>

<dl>

<dt id="send2slurm">send2slurm</dt>
<dd>

<p>The function takes a HASH as input where all the information relative to the job should be stored. No data is mandatory inside the input HASH, since the minimal values are automagicaly asigned by default as a constructor (no really, but anyway).</p>

<p>Take into account that this subroutine only pass the parameters to SLURM. So, the logic behind your actions should correspond to what you want to do in any case, exactly as if you were writing sbatch scripts.</p>

<p>The managed options for SLURM jobs are:</p>

<pre><code>        - filename: File where the sbatch script will be stored
        - job_name: Job name for SLURM (-J) 
        - cpus: Number of CPUs to be used by each job (-c)
        - mem_per_cpu: Amount of memory to be used for each CPU (--mem-per-cpu)
        - time: Maximum time that the job will be allowed to run (--time)
        - output: File where the sbatch script output will be stored (-o)
        - partition: SLURM partition to be used (-p)
        - gres: GPUs to be used (--gres)
        - command: Command to be executed at sbatch script
        - mailtype: Type of warning to be emailed (--mail-type)
        - dependency: Full dependency string to be used at sbatch execution (--dependency), see more below</code></pre>

<p>The function returns the jobid of the queued job, so it can be used to build complex workflows.</p>

<p>usage: my $job_id = send2slurm(\%job_properties);</p>

<p>Warning email: By default, if an empty HASH is passed to the function, a no command sbatch script is launched with --mail-type=END option. The intention is that this could be used to warn at the end of any launched swarm. Also, by changing <b>mailtype</b> but ommiting the <b>command</b> value you can force the function to execute an empty sbatch job with whatever warning behavior that you choose.</p>

<p>Dependencies: If dependencies are going to be used, you need to pass to the function the full string that SLURM expects. That is, you can pass something like <i>singleton</i> or <i>after:000000</i> or even <i>afterok:000000,000001,000002</i>. This last can be build, by example, storing every previous jobid into an ARRAY and passing then as,</p>

<pre><code>        ...
                my $jobid = send2slurm(\%previous);
                push @jobids, $jobid;
        ...
        $task{&#39;dependency&#39;} = &#39;afterok:&#39;.join(&#39;,&#39;,@jobids);
        ...
        send2slurm(\%task);</code></pre>

<p>Of course, if dependencies are not going to be used, the <b>dependency</b> option could be safely ignored. But notice that, if you are reusing a HASH then this key should be deleted from it.</p>
