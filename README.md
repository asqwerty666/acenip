# ACE NeuroImaging Pipeline 

ACE Neuroimaging pipeline is a collection of perl and bash scripts (mostly) that are used to
run neuroimaging analysis with popular software packages like FSL, Freesurfer or ANTs. 

Current development version of the pipeline (v0.5.1) is intended to be used in conjunction 
with XNAT and is completed integrated into the SLUM cluster.
